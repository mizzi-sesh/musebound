# Musebound
(Goal): A modern, sleek roleplaying website prioritising safety, customisation and access where text-based roleplayers can connect to roleplay prompts of their interest. 

## Project
In it's current form, Musebound is only an image gallery application, as a test to ensure the various tools and frameworks are working together. Many basic features are working, and Musebound will continuously be updated to be a great text-based roleplaying hub.
